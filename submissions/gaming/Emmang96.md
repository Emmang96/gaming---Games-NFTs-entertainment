### Description
What problem does your vApp solve? What does it do?

-- I want to add an idea or suggestion for the ecosystem in sui related to the Soundness Project, maybe GameFI can be held for example AAA games (off the Grid) because in today's era the narrative is for games based on NFT Blockchain Games where the games can already compete with console games, in other words the game (off the grid) made by the Avalance ecosystem (avax) has been booming among world streamers, I hope you are interested in the suggestions I have given and I apologize if the context I have given is a little off
